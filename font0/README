Directory lout/font0 - font metrics for ASCII

This directory contains Adobe Systems font metrics
(.AFM) files for the ASCII character set, exactly as
distributed by Adobe Systems except that erroneous
ligature information has been removed from Couri*.AFM
(Courier font).  These files are the source of Lout's
information about the height and width of all characters.
