Directory lout/font1 - font metrics for ISO-LATIN-1

This directory is supposed to contain Adobe Systems
font metrics (.AFM) files for the ISO-LATIN-1
character set.  They are the source of Lout's
information about the height and width of all
characters.

At the time of writing the directory is empty
because I don't have these files.
