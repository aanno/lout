Version 2.xx is not completely upward compatible with the original October
1991 release.  The Lout base language semantics have changed slightly (some
objects come out wider than they used to), but more importantly the standard
packages DocumentLayout, ReportLayout, and BookLayout have been coalesced
into one, and some changes made to some of the symbols.  This means that
most setup files will need to be changed.  The more specialized packages
(Tab, Eq, Fig, and Pas) are compatible with the old versions.  Apologies for
any inconvenience caused.
