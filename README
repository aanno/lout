Version 2.05 is substantially different from Version 2.03 in its
low-level character handling and attention to strong typing, as well
as in the major innovation of support for ISO-LATIN-1 characters and
arbitrary PostScript encoding vectors.  There is also a change in the
database index (.li) file format, which means that all old database
index files should be deleted before using Version 2.05.
