Directory lout/evec - character encoding vector (CEV) files

This directory contains character encoding vector (CEV) files,
describing mappings from 8-bit character codes to the character
names found in AFM files.  The CEV format is hereby defined as
256 character names, separated by arbitrary blank spaces and
newlines.  Comments and other matter are not permitted.  See
the accompanying files for examples.

  Std.CEV        The StandardEncoding encoding vector, exactly
                 as on page 598 of the PostScript LRM 2nd Ed.

  Latin1.CEV     The ISOLatin1Encoding encoding vector, exactly
                 as on page 599 of the PostScript LRM 2nd Ed.
                 This is not usable with Lout as it stands
                 because the ligature characters fi and fl have
                 no encoding, and because the standard packages
		 use characters that are not in this encoding.

  LoutLatin1.CEV Equal to Latin1.CEV augmented with the following
                 characters used by Lout and its standard packages:

		   quotedblleft	  \205  used in DocumentLayout
		   quotedblright  \206  used in DocumentLayout
		   fi		  \207	must encode all ligatures
		   fl		  \210	must encode all ligatures
		   endash	  \211	used in DocumentLayout
		   emdash	  \212	used in DocumentLayout
		   bullet	  \213	used in DocumentLayout
		   dagger	  \214	used in DocumentLayout
		   daggerdbl	  \215	used in DocumentLayout
		   florin	  \216	used in DocumentLayout
		   fraction	  \217	used in Pas

		 Also the character at position \055 has been
		 changed from minus to hyphen; the minus character
		 is not encoded in this vector.

  Symb.CEV       The Symbol encoding vector, exactly as on page
                 606 of the PostScript LRM 2nd Ed.

  Ding.CEV       The Zapf Dingbats encoding vector, taken from
                 the Zapf Dingbats AFM file.

  null.oct       Useful skeleton files for building encoding
  null.dec       vectors, given octal or decimal character code
                 info.  Don't forget to delete the leftmost
                 column, which is just a construction guide.
