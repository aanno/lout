This manual is addressed to those who wish to become
expert users of the document formatting language Lout.  An expert user
is someone who understands the principles of document formatting
that Lout embodies, and is able to apply them, for example to design
a document format or a special-purpose package.  In contrast, a non-expert
user is someone who simply uses Lout to format documents.
@PP
Chapter {@NumberOf principles} explains these principles, and it
should be read carefully and in sequence.  Chapters {@NumberOf details}
and {@NumberOf symbols} are for reference; respectively, they
contain descriptions of the detailed operation of Lout's major
components, and a complete description of each predefined symbol.  The
final chapter presents a collection of advanced examples.
@PP
This manual presents Version 2.05 of Basser Lout, publicly released in
July 1993 [{@Ref kingston93basser}].  Those familiar
with Version 1 will notice many enhancements, including PostScript
@FootNote { PostScript is a trademark of Adobe Systems, Inc. }
EPS file inclusion, optimal paragraph breaking, automatic hyphenation,
ligatures, and support for the ISO-LATIN-1 character set.

@DP
@Heading { Acknowledgment. }  Version 2.05 has benefited from hundreds of
comments received since the release of Version 1 in October 1991 and
Version 2.01 in early 1993.  Not every suggestion could be followed,
but many have been, and the encouragement was greatly appreciated.
