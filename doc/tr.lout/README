Directory lout/doc/tr.lout

This directory contains the Lout source files for the
report `Document Formatting with Lout (Second Edition)',
also known as  the Lout user manual.  To produce the
report, type the command

	lout setup ch?.?? > outfile.ps

in this directory.  This must be done four times to
completely resolve all cross references, although
the PostScript file outfile.ps is printable after
the first run.  Auxiliary files with .li and .ld
suffixes will be created in this directory.  A copy
of the final outfile.ps is included.
