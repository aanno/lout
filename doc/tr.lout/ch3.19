   @Title { The cross reference symbol "&&" }
   @Tag { crossref }
@Begin
@PP
The cross reference symbol @Code "&&" takes the name of a symbol (not an
object) for its left parameter, and an object whose value must be a
simple word for its right parameter.  The result is a cross reference,
which may be thought of as an arrow pointing from the cross reference
symbol to the beginning of an invocation of the named symbol.
@PP
The invocation pointed to, known as the @I target of the cross
reference, is generally one whose @@Tag parameter has value equal
to the right parameter of the cross reference symbol.  Two special tags,
@Code preceding and {@Code following}, point respectively
to the first invocation preceding the cross reference in the final
printed document, and the first following it.
@PP
A cross reference may be used in four ways:  where an object is
expected, in which case its value is a copy of the target; with the
@@Open and @@Use symbols; with the @@Tagged
symbol; and in the @Code into clause of a galley definition, in which
case the value of the tag must be @Code preceding or {@Code following}.
