A footnote is created by typing
@ID @Code "@FootNote { Like this. }"
after the word that the footnote refers to.  It will be numbered
automatically and placed at the foot of the page or column;
@FootNote { Like this. }
or, if space there is insufficient, it may start on or run onto the
following page or column.  Figures are created in a similar way:
@ID @Code {
"@Figure"
"    @Caption { Basser Lout }"
"@Fig {"
"    @Box Lout &"
"    @HArrow { 2c @Wide } &"
"    @Box PostScript"
"}"
}
The @Code "@Figure" symbol places the figure (which in this example is
created using the Fig figure drawing package [{@Ref kingston92fig}]) at
the top of the following column or page,
@Figure
    @Caption { Basser Lout }
@Fig {
    @Box Lout &
    @HArrow { 2c @Wide } &
    @Box PostScript
}
labelled by the @Code "@Caption" option and automatically numbered.  Unlike
footnotes, figures will not break across several pages; each figure must
fit on one page.
@PP
Tables are obtained in the same way using {@Code "@Table"} instead of
{@Code "@Figure"}.
