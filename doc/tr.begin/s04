This section explains how to gain access to the many different fonts and
unusual characters available with Lout.
@PP
We are already familiar with the @Code "@I" symbol, which changes the font
of the following thing to {@I Italic}.  Similarly, there is @Code "@B" for
{@B Bold}, @Code "@S" for @S SMALL {@S CAPITALS},
@FootNote {
Owing to problems behind the scenes, if several words are grouped within one
@Code "@S" symbol they will be kept together on one line, so to get small
capitals over several lines it is necessary to apply @Code "@S" to each
word individually.  This does not happen with other font symbols.
}
and @Code "@R" for Roman.
@PP
The @Code "@Font" symbol can be used to get many other fonts (a local
expert should be able to supply the full list):
@ID @Code {
"{ Helvetica Slope } @Font Hello"
"{ Courier Base } @Font { Hello there }"
}
has result
@ID {
{ Helvetica Slope } @Font Hello
{ Courier Base } @Font { Hello there }
}
Each font has a family name, such as Times, Helvetica, or Courier, and a
face name, generally Base, Slope, or Bold.  The fonts that were
called Roman, Italic, and Bold above are Times Base, Times Slope, and
Times Bold.  When changing families the new family and a face must be
specified, but when changing face within a family just the face name is
enough.
@PP
The @Code "@Font" symbol also changes sizes:
@ID @Code {
"+5p @Font Hello"
"-3p @Font Hello"
"12p @Font Hello"
}
has result
@ID {
+5p @Font Hello  -3p @Font Hello  12p @Font Hello
}
with the first Hello 5 points larger than it would have been otherwise,
the second 3 points smaller, and the third in a 12 point font.  There are
72 points to one inch, and most documents are set in 10 or 12 point.
@PP
There are symbols for some unusual characters that do not appear
on keyboards:
@ID {
     @Code "--"		|0.35i	--	   
/1vx @Code "---"	|	---	   
/1vx @Code "@Bullet"	|	@Bullet	   
/1vx @Code "@Star"	|	@Star	   
/1vx @Code "@ParSym"	|	@ParSym	   
/1vx @Code "@SectSym"	|	@SectSym   
/1vx @Code "@Dagger"	|	@Dagger	   
/1vx @Code "@DaggerDbl"	|	@DaggerDbl 
/1vx @Code "@CDot"	|	@CDot	   
/1vx @Code "@Sterling"	|	@Sterling  
/1vx @Code "@Yen"	|	@Yen
/1vx @Code "@Florin"	|	@Florin
/1vx @Code "@Degree"	|	@Degree
/1vx @Code "@Minute"	|	@Minute
/1vx @Code "@Second"	|	@Second
/1vx @Code "@Lozenge"	|	@Lozenge
/1vx @Code "@Multiply"  |	@Multiply
/1vx @Code "@Divide"    |	@Divide
/1vx @Code "@CopyRight" |	@CopyRight
/1vx @Code "@Register"  |	@Register
/1vx @Code "@TradeMark" |	@TradeMark
/1vx @Code "@Date"	|	@Date
}
These may be used anywhere.  The Adobe Systems Symbol font has many more such
characters; the Eq equation formatting package [{@Ref kingston92eq}] has
the complete list.  For example, @Code "@Eq { heart }" will give @Eq { heart }.
