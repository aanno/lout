   @Title { Changing the overall appearance }
@Begin
@PP
A few aspects of the overall appearance of the document may be changed
by beginning with a @Code "@Document" symbol, as in the following
example:
@ID @Code {
"@Document"
"    @InitialFont { Times Base 12p }"
"    @InitialBreak { adjust 1.2fx }"
"    @Hyphenate { Yes }"
"    @PageNumbers { Yes }"
"    @FirstPageNumber { 1 }"
"    @Columns { Double }"
"//"
"@Text @Begin"
"..."
"@End @Text"
}
This shows the six options available with {@Code "@Document"}, and their
default values.
@PP
@Code "@InitialFont" and @Code "@InitialBreak" determine
the overall font and paragraph breaking style; @Code "1.2fx" means that
the inter-line spacing is to be 1.2 times the current font size, measured
from baseline to baseline.  To get double spacing, use {@Code "2.4fx"},
etc.  @Code "@Hyphenate" determines whether hyphenation is permitted or
not, and may be @Code Yes or {@Code No}.
@PP
@Code "@PageNumbers" determines whether or not page numbers will be
printed (but not their format), and also may be @Code Yes or {@Code No};
@Code "@FirstPageNumber" is the number given to the first page; and
@Code "@Columns" determines the number of columns that @Code "@ColText"
produces, and may be {@Code Single}, {@Code Double}, or {@Code Multi},
the last usually meaning triple.
@PP
Since there are default values for the options, it is only necessary to
mention those options that are to be changed.  For example, to produce a
document in Helvetica 10 point font with no page numbers, begin with
@ID @Code {
"@Document"
"    @InitialFont { Helvetica Base 10p }"
"    @PageNumbers { No }"
"//"
}
Disaster will ensue if the @Code "//" symbol is forgotten.  The
@Code "@Doc" symbol used previously is just an abbreviation for
{@Code "@Document //"}.
@PP
Of course, these five options only scratch the surface of the possible
changes that could be made.  Section {@NumberOf big.changes} explains
how to make many other and more radical changes to the overall appearance
of the document.
