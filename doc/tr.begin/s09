@I {Cross references} like `see page {@PageOf cross}' are a useful feature of
documents, but they are troublesome to authors, since, as the document
is revised, the thing on page {@PageOf cross} might find itself on page
{@PageOf reportlayout} and the cross reference must be changed.  Lout has
a simple solution to this problem:  instead of writing the page number
directly, write
@ID @Code "see page {@PageOf taxinfo}"
instead, and at the point referred to, write
@ID @Code "Taxation {@PageMark taxinfo} ..."
@Code "{@PageMark taxinfo}" will not appear in the output, but Lout makes
a note of the number of the page on which the word preceding it appears,
and inserts that number in place of {@Code "{@PageOf taxinfo}"}.  Any
single word may be used for the tag.
@PP
Cross referencing also applies to sections, subsections, appendices,
subappendices, figures, tables, and numbered displays, and can supply
both the page on which the item begins and its number.  First, add a
@Code "@Tag" option whose value is a single word:
@ID @Code {
"@Section"
"     @Title { Cross references }"
"     @Tag { cross }"
"@Begin"
"..."
}
This marks the page on which the section begins, so @Code "{@PageOf cross}"
will be {@PageOf cross} in this case.  In addition, @Code "{@NumberOf cross}"
will be the number of the section, in this case {@NumberOf cross}.
