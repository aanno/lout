   @Title { Paragraph breaking }
@Begin
@PP
Lout takes the words or other things making up a paragraph and fills
lines with them.  If two words are separated by one space in the input,
they will be separated by one space in the output; two spaces in, two
spaces out, and so on.  The end of a line counts as one space, and a tab
character as eight.  These spaces are then enlarged to remove ragged line ends.
@PP
This process is called @I paragraph {@I breaking}, and the enlargement
of spaces is @I {line adjustment.}  The @Code "@Break" symbol, which is
most commonly used with displays and list items, affects paragraph
breaking:
@ID @Code {
"@IndentedDisplay ragged @Break {"
"This little paragraph will appear with"
"ragged ends to its lines."
"}"
}
has result
@IndentedDisplay 4c @Wide ragged @Break {
This little paragraph will appear with
ragged ends to its lines.
}
when placed in a four centimetre column; line adjustment is turned
off.  Also available are @Code "cragged @Break" and {@Code "rragged @Break"},
which centre or right-justify each line respectively after breaking.
@PP
It is also possible to have paragraphs broken in the output at the same
places they are broken in the input, using { @Code "lines @Break" }:
@ID @Code {
"@CenteredDisplay lines @Break @I {"
"Teach me to hear Mermaides singing,"
"Or to keep off envies stinging,"
"     And finde"
"     What winde"
"Serves to'advance an honest minde."
"}"
}
has result
@CenteredDisplay lines @Break @I {
Teach me to hear Mermaides singing,
Or to keep off envies stinging,
     And finde
     What winde
Serves to'advance an honest minde.
}
With @Code "lines @Break" it makes sense to indent individual lines in the
input (except the first), as shown.  To centre or right-justify each line, use
{@Code "clines @Break"} or {@PageMark clines} {@Code "rlines @Break"}.
@PP
The usual method, where Lout fills and adjusts lines, is called
{@Code "adjust @Break"}.  It has a variant called {@Code "outdent @Break"}
which inserts a small space at the beginning of each line except the first.
@PP
The @Code "@Break" symbol also controls hyphenation:  @Code "hyphen"
@Code "@Break" turns it on, @Code "nohyphen" @Code "@Break" turns it
off.  For example, ragged breaking is often done without hyphenation,
like this:
@ID @Code {
"@ID { ragged nohyphen } @Break {"
"This little paragraph will appear with"
"ragged ends to its lines."
"}"
}
To prevent hyphenation in the entire document, see Section
{@NumberOf changes}.  To tell Lout where you would prefer a hyphen to be 
inserted (rarely necessary), use the @Code "&-" symbol:
@ID @Code {
"incent&-iv&-ate"
}
If @Code "&-" occurs directly after a hyphen character, hyphenation will
be permitted but no extra hyphen will be inserted.
