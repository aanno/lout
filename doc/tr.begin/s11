DocumentLayout normally produces pages with a single column of text occupying
the full width.  To get multiple columns, enclose the document in
@ID @Code {
"@Doc @ColText @Begin"
"..."
"@End @ColText"
}
This will ordinarily produce two columns per page, although we will see
in the next section how to produce three or more.
@PP
It is possible to start off a document with single columns and switch to
multiple columns later, using the following arrangement:
@ID @Code {
"@Doc @Text @Begin"
"single column part"
"@ColText @Begin"
"multiple column part"
"@End @ColText"
"@End @Text"
}
This is the most useful combination, because switching from multiple back to
single causes a new page to be begun, which generally looks poor.  Tables
and figures are always full width, but the width of footnotes depends on
whether they occur within @Code "@Text" or {@Code "@ColText"}.
