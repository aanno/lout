@Abstract {
This report is a beginners' guide to the Lout document formatting
system.  It shows in a very practical, step-by-step way how to produce
documents with paragraphs, headings, fonts, displays and lists,
footnotes, numbered sections, references, tables and figures, and so on,
using the DocumentLayout package (Version 2), which is designed for
producing simple documents, technical reports, and books.  The underlying
principles of Lout are not explained here.
