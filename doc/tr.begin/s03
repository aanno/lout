@PP
We have just seen that consecutive displays are awkward to space
correctly.  Provided they are not aligned or numbered,
these are better treated as a {@I list}:
@ID @Code {
"... preceding text."
"@IndentedList"
"@ListItem @I Emma"
"@ListItem @I { Mansfield Park }"
"@EndList"
"following text ..."
}
There are {@Code "@LeftList"}, {@Code "@IndentedList"}, and
@Code "@CentredList" (or {@Code "@CenteredList"}) symbols; each item is
introduced by {@Code "@ListItem"}, and the list ends with
{@Code "@EndList"}.  There may be any number of items; @Code "@DP"
symbols are inserted before, between, and after them.
@PP
A variety of automatically generated tags is available for indented
lists.  Here is the full set, showing the first tag produced:
@ID {
     @Code "@NumberedList"	|1c	1.
/1vx @Code "@ParenNumberedList" |	(1)
/1vx @Code "@RomanList"		|	i.
/1vx @Code "@ParenRomanList"	|	(i)
/1vx @Code "@UCRomanList"	|	I.
/1vx @Code "@ParenUCRomanList"	|	(I)
/1vx @Code "@AlphaList"		|	a.
/1vx @Code "@ParenAlphaList"	|	(a)
/1vx @Code "@UCAlphaList"	|	A.
/1vx @Code "@ParenUCAlphaList"	|	(A)
/1vx @Code "@BulletList"	|	@Bullet
/1vx @Code "@StarList"		|	@Star
/1vx @Code "@DashList"		|	--
}
The Roman numerals end at c (100), and the alphabet ends
at z (26), but ordinary numbers have no limit.  For example,
@ID @Code {
"@Heading { Quiz }"
"@NumberedList"
"@ListItem { Which American"
"statesman owned a"
"two-storey clock? }"
"@ListItem { Which Yankee"
"commander cut a swathe of"
"destruction through the"
"State of Georgia? }"
"@EndList"
}
has result
@ID {
@Heading { Quiz }
@DP
@RawNumberedList
@ListItem { Which American
statesman owned a
two-storey clock? }
@ListItem { Which Yankee
commander cut a swathe of
destruction through the
State of Georgia? }
@EndList
}
Alternatively, the tags may be supplied by the author, using the
@Code "@TaggedList" symbol and its variants @Code "@WideTaggedList" and
{@Code "@VeryWideTaggedList"}, which leave a wider indent for the tags:
@ID @Code {
"@WideTaggedList"
"{ 9 a.m. } @TagItem { Breakfast in"
"the Ipamena Lounge, served with"
"Irish coffee and fresh croissants. }"
"{ 10 a.m. } @TagItem { Prof. A. Smith"
"speaks on `The Wealth of Nations.' }"
"@EndList"
}
has result
@ID {
@RawWideTaggedList
{ 9 a.m. } @TagItem { Breakfast in
the Ipamena Lounge, served with
Irish coffee and fresh croissants. }
{ 10 a.m. } @TagItem { Prof. A. Smith
speaks on `The Wealth of Nations.' }
@EndList
}
Each @Code "@TagItem" symbol uses the thing just preceding it as the tag.
@PP
Each of these lists also has a `raw' version which omits the preceding
and following space.  These are mainly used when an item is itself a list:
@ID @Code {
"@ParenNumberedList"
"@ListItem {"
"   @RawParenRomanList"
"   @ListItem { MV Nominees,"
"hereinafter called the vendor, ... }"
"   @EndList"
"}"
"@EndList"
}
has result
@ID {
@RawParenNumberedList
@ListItem {
   @RawParenRomanList
   @ListItem { MV Nominees,
hereinafter called the vendor, ... }
   @EndList
}
@EndList
}
If @Code "@ParenRomanList" had been used instead of
{@Code "@RawParenRomanList"}, (1) and (i) would have appeared on
different lines.
@PP
In cases where it is desired to have a paragraph symbol following a raw
list, owing to problems behind the scenes this symbol should be placed
before the first {@Code "@ListItem"} or {@Code "@TagItem"}, not after
the @Code "@EndList" as would naturally be expected.
@PP
A finer control over the appearance of lists is obtained with
@Code "@RawIndentedList" and {@Code "@RawTaggedList"}.  These
have {@I options}:  optional subsidiary symbols which modify the
result.  For example,
@ID @Code {
"@RawIndentedList"
"     style { [tag] }"
"     indent { 0.5i }"
"     gap { 0.3v }"
"     start { 5 }"
"@ListItem { ... }"
"@ListItem { ... }"
"@EndList"
}
shows the four options available with {@Code "@RawIndentedList"}, namely
{@Code style}, @Code {indent}, {@Code gap}, and {@Code start}.  It
has result
@ID {
@RawIndentedList
     style { [tag] }
     indent { 0.5i }
     gap { 0.3v }
     start { 5 }
@ListItem { ... }
@ListItem { ... }
@EndList
}
The @Code style option determines the appearance of each tag, any
@Code tag symbol
within it being replaced by the number of the item.  If numbers are not
wanted in the tag, @Code tag may be omitted.  The other options
determine the indent, the gap between items, and the number of the first
item.  In general, options may be given in any order, and if omitted
will revert to a reasonable standard value.  @Code "@RawTaggedList" works
in a similar way, except that @Code tag is replaced by the tag supplied
by the @Code "@TagItem" symbol, and there is no @Code start option.  The
symbol @Code "@DP" may be used above or below the list to produce the
usual amount of space.
@PP
Individual list items are kept together on one page or column.  However,
a new page may be started between two list items.
@PP
Every symbol introduced in this section has an abbreviated form consisting
of @Code "@" followed by its capital letters only.  For example,
@Code "@RawNumberedList" abbreviates to {@Code "@RNL"}, and
@Code "@ListItem" to {@Code "@LI"}.
