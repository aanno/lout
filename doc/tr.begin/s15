@Begin
@PP
The DocumentLayout package makes a large number
of decisions, about how large the pages will be, which fonts will
ordinarily be used, and so on.  The more complex decisions, such as the
appearance of tables of contents in books, can only be changed by
modifying the packages,  but many of the simpler decisions can be changed
quite easily by setting options in the setup file.
@PP
The first step is to obtain a private copy of the setup file.  A local
expert will know where these files are kept; for example, in directory
{ @Code "/usr/lout/include"}.  Suppose the @Code report setup file is
copied into a file called { @Code myrep }; then typing
@ID @Code "lout myrep myfile"
instead of
@ID @Code "lout -ireport myfile"
runs Lout with the private copy of the setup file, {@Code "myrep"}.
@PP
Exactly what the setup file contains will depend upon the local
situation, but it will be something like this:
@ID @Code {
"# Setup file for reports."
"# J. H. Kingston, July 1991"
""
"@SysInclude { ft }"
"@SysInclude { dl }"
"# @SysInclude { eq }"
"# @SysInclude { pas }"
"# @SysInclude { fig }"
"# @SysInclude { tab }"
""
"@Use { @DocumentLayout"
"  # @InitialFont { Times Base 12p }"
"  # @InitialBreak { adjust 1.2fx }"
"  # @Hyphenate { Yes }"
"  # @PageNumbers { Yes }"
"  # @Columns { Single }"
"  # @HeadingFont { Bold }"
"  # @ParaIndent { 2.0f }"
"  # @PageTop { |0.5rt - @PageNum - }"
"  # @PageFoot { @Null }"
"}"
}
Whenever Lout encounters a @Code "#" character not enclosed in quotes,
it ignores it and everything following it up to the end of the line.  The
first two lines of the setup file, then, are comments for the human
reader.  After them come lines which cause Lout to read the file
@Code "ft" of font definitions and the file @Code "dl" which contains
the definition of the DocumentLayout package.
@PP
The next four lines are comments and will be ignored, but if the initial
@Code "#" is deleted they cause Lout to read the definitions of the Eq
equation formatting package and the Pas Pascal program formatting package
[{@Ref kingston92eq}], the Fig diagram drawing package [{@Ref kingston92fig}],
and the Tab table formatting package [{@Ref kingston92tab}].
@PP
Next comes a @Code "@DocumentLayout" symbol within a @Code "@Use"
clause.  It is this symbol whose options may
be changed so as to affect the overall layout.  These options are listed
as comments on the following lines, together with the default value
of each.  To change an option, delete the @Code "#" and change the
value.  For example, the normal paragraph indent produced by @Code "@PP" is
@Code "2.0f" (twice the current font size).  To change it, say to
{@Code "3.0f"}, change the line to
@ID @Code "@ParaIndent { 3.0f }"
The display indent option (not shown here) should probably be changed as well.
@PP
The first five options have the same name as five of the @Code "@Document"
symbol's options, and they determine the default value of those
options.  The @Code "@PageTop" and @Code "@PageFoot" options determine
the appearance of the page header and footer lines (where the page
numbers appear), and are best left to experts;  but, for example,
@ID @Code "@PageTop { |1rt  @PageNum }"
will make the page number appear at the top right of each page, without
the @Code "-" characters.
@PP
Those who wish to make more radical changes will have to copy the @Code dl
file and change the definition of the DocumentLayout package.  This requires
knowledge of the principles of Lout, and the primitive features from which
others are built, as described in the Lout user manual [{@Ref kingston92}].
