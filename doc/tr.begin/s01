The Lout document formatting system has been designed with the
needs of the ordinary user very much in mind.  Although the features of Lout
are virtually endless, and include mathematical equations, diagrams made
from lines and shapes, bibliographic databases, and so on, the system is
very simple to use.
@PP
Document formatting with Lout begins with the creation of a file like
the following:
@ID @Code {
"@Doc @Text @Begin"
"@Heading { Introduction }"
"@PP"
"For Virginia Woolf, @I Middlemarch"
"was `the magnificent book which"
"for all its imperfections is one"
"of the few English novels written"
"for grown-up people.'"
"@End @Text"
}
Ordinary words are mixed with symbols of special meaning, such as
{@Code "@Doc"}, {@Code "@Text"}, {@Code "@Heading"}, and
{@Code "@I"}.  Most symbols begin with {@Code "@"}, but some, like
{@Code "{"} and {@Code "}"}, do not.  It doesn't matter where the lines
end:  the end of a line is treated the same as a single space.
@PP
This file is then processed by the Basser Lout interpreter, for example
by typing
@ID @Code "lout -idoc simple > simple.ps"
on the Unix
@FootNote { Unix is a trademark of "AT&T" Bell Laboratories. &0io }
operating system, assuming that the file's name is
{@Code "simple"}.  The @Code "-idoc" part instructs Lout to include a
special @I {setup file} called {@Code doc}, in which the symbols are
defined.  The output is the PostScript
@FootNote { PostScript is a trademark of Adobe Systems, Inc. &0io }
file {@Code "simple.ps"}, which is suitable for printing on most laser
printers and many other devices.  When printed, it will appear like this:
@ID {
@Heading { Introduction }
@PP
For Virginia Woolf, @I Middlemarch was `the magnificent book which
for all its imperfections is one of the few English novels written
for grown-up people.'
}
The meaning of each symbol is now clear.  @Code "@Doc @Text @Begin" and
@Code "@End @Text" have no visible effect, but they always bracket the
document as a whole.  @Code "@Heading" makes the following thing into
a heading; there is also @Code "@MajorHeading" for producing a large
heading, and @Code "@MinorHeading" for a subheading.  The @Code "@PP"
symbol starts a paragraph whose first line is indented; also available
are {@Code "@LP"} which omits the indent, {@Code "@DP"} which leaves the
amount of vertical space used for displays, and {@Code "@NP"}, which
starts a new page or column (rarely used, since Lout does this
automatically when the old one fills).  Finally, @Code "@I" changes the
font of the following thing to {@I Italic}.
@PP
Braces are used to group parts of the document together so that nearby
symbols will affect the whole part.  For example,
@ID @Code "@I { Scenes of Clerical Life }"
produces {@I { Scenes of Clerical Life }}.  The braces around
@Code "Introduction" in the example above are not strictly necessary,
since a single word does not need to be grouped; but a longer heading
would require them.  Braces also help when a symbol must be immediately
adjacent to another symbol or to a word:
@ID @Code "QuikWipe{@TradeMark}"
has result QuikWipe{@TradeMark}.  Without them Lout would confuse the
two.  In a similar way, @Code "{@I Middlemarch}," produces
{@I Middlemarch}, with the comma not set in Italic.
@PP
Characters like "{", which normally are symbols, will be
treated as ordinary words when enclosed in double quotes.  For example,
@Code "\"{\"" produces "{".  The characters
@ID @Code "/    |    &    {    }    #    @    ^"
should always be so enclosed, since otherwise they will have special
effects.
@PP
The symbols described above form part of the {@I DocumentLayout @I package},
a collection of symbols designed to make day-to-day document formatting
easy.  This package also provides symbols for producing displays and
lists, numbered sections, subsections, and appendices, footnotes,
figures, tables, references, and cross references.  These are described
in later sections of this report.  This same package may also be used to
produce technical reports and books, as described in Sections
@NumberOf reportlayout and {@NumberOf booklayout}.
