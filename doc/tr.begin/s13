@PP
This section describes how to use the DocumentLayout package to produce
technical reports like the present document.  Type @Code "-ireport" in
the Unix command instead of @Code "-idoc" to use the package in this
way.  We present only the differences here; everything else works as
before.
@PP
A technical report begins with a @Code "@Report" symbol analogous to the
@Code "@Document" symbol described in the previous section.  Here it is,
with its nine options and their default values:
@ID @Code {
"@Report"
"    @Title {}"
"    @Author {}"
"    @Institution {}"
"    @DateLine { @Date }"
"    @InitialFont { Times Base 12p }"
"    @InitialBreak { adjust 1.2fx }"
"    @Hyphenate { Yes }"
"    @PageNumbers { Yes }"
"    @Columns { Single }"
"//"
}
The {@Code "@Title"}, {@Code "@Author"}, and {@Code "@Institution"} options
will be printed on the cover sheet and on the first page; they are formatted
using {@Code "clines @Break"} (see page {@PageOf clines}).  Multiple authors
should be given on separate lines within the @Code "@Author"
option.  {@Code "@DateLine"} appears below the abstract on the cover sheet,
and its default value is the current date as shown.  {@Code "@InitialFont"},
{@Code "@InitialBreak"}, {@Code "@Hyphenate"}, {@Code "@PageNumbers"} and
{@Code "@Columns"} are as described in the last section, except that there
is nothing analogous to @Code "@Text" and {@Code "@ColText"}:  if
@Code "@Columns" is set to {@Code Double}, the entire document after the
title will be set in two columns.  There is no @Code "@FirstPageNumber"
option.  As for {@Code "@Document"}, the symbol @Code "//" must follow
after, and disaster will ensue if it is omitted.
@PP
If the technical report has an abstract, it comes next:
@ID @Code {
"@Abstract @Begin"
"..."
"..."
"@End @Abstract"
}
The cover sheet of the present report shows how this will
appear.  @Code "@Abstract" has a @Code "@Title" option like the ones
below; its default value is {@I ABSTRACT}.
@PP
Next come the sections of the report, each enclosed in a @Code
"@Section" symbol:
@ID @Code {
"@Section"
"    @Title { Introduction }"
"@Begin"
"@PP"
"..."
"..."
"@End @Section"
}
No @Code "@BeginSections" or @Code "@EndSections" symbols are needed.
 The sections may contain subsections, preceded as usual by
@Code "@BeginSubSections" and followed by {@Code "@EndSubSections"}.
 After the sections there is opportunity for a sequence of appendices,
each of the form
@ID @Code {
"@Appendix"
"    @Title { ... }"
"@Begin"
"@PP"
"..."
"..."
"@End @Appendix"
}
but these are quite optional.  No @Code "@BeginAppendices" and
@Code "@EndAppendices" symbols are needed.  An appendix may contain
sub-appendices via the usual symbols {@Code "@BeginSubAppendices"},
{@Code "@SubAppendix"}, and {@Code "@BeginSubAppendices"}.  This ends
the input; there is no {@Code "@End @Text"}, and any reference section
will be added automatically.
@End @Section
