Occasionally Lout will insert a page break directly following a heading,
and this looks very poor.  The solution is to precede the heading with
the conditional new page symbol {@Code "@CNP"}, which checks whether
enough space is left in the page or column for a heading and at least
two lines of text.  If so, @Code "@CNP" does nothing; if not, @Code "@CNP"
causes a new page or column to be begun, like {@Code "@NP"}.  The recommended
arrangement is
@ID @Code {
"end of previous part."
"@DP"
"@CNP"
"@Heading { A Heading }"
"@PP"
"First paragraph of next part ..."
}
The @Code "@CNP" symbol should be preceded by either @Code "@DP" or
@Code "@LP", preferably {@Code "@DP"}, and this determines the amount of
space when the @Code "@NP" action does not occur.  In most cases it will
be better to use the @Code "@Section" symbol described below, which has
@Code "@CNP" included in it, rather than using @Code "@CNP" directly.
