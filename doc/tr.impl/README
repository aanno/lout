Directory lout/doc/tr.impl

This directory contains the Lout source files for the
report entitled `The design and implementation of the
Lout document formatting language'  which has been
accepted for publication in Software - Practice and
Experience.  To produce the report, type the command

	lout setup s?.? > outfile.ps

in this directory.  This must be done three times to
completely resolve all cross references, although
the PostScript file outfile.ps is printable after
the first run.  Auxiliary files with .li and .ld
suffixes will be created in this directory.  A copy
of the final outfile.ps is included.
