@Abstract
   @Title { SUMMARY }
{
Lout is a high-level language for document formatting, whose ease of use
has permitted an unprecedented number of advanced features to be added
quickly and reliably.  This paper charts the evolution of the design and
implementation of Lout from conception in mid-1984 to public release in
October 1991.  It includes extensive discussions of remaining problems
and possible solutions.
