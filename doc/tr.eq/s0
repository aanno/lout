@Abstract {
This report describes the use of Eq, a package of definitions for
typesetting mathematics with the Lout document formatter.  For example,
@ID @Code "@Eq { big int supp 1 on 0 ` dx over sqrt {1 - x sup 2} = pi over 2 }"
produces the output
@ID @Eq { big int supp 1 on 0 ` dx over sqrt {1 - x sup 2} = pi over 2 }
The advantages of Eq include careful attention to details of spacing, a
repertoire of several hundred mathematical symbols, a simple syntax
extensible by the user, and complete integration with the rest of Lout.
@PP
In addition, this report contains an appendix describing the use of Pas,
a package of definitions for printing Pascal programs.
