Eq is a package of definitions for typesetting mathematics with the Lout
document formatter [{@Ref kingston92}].  It includes several hundred
mathematical and other special characters (including the entire PostScript
@FootNote { PostScript is a trademark of Adobe Systems, Incorporated. }
Symbol font [{@Ref adobe90}]), and a smaller number of symbols for joining
objects together in mathematical ways.  Eq is based on the eqn language
of Kernighan and Cherry [{@Ref kernighan75}], with
spacing rules similar to Knuth's @TeX formatter [{@Ref knuth84}].
@PP
To use Eq in a Lout document, first ensure that its definition is
included, either by having @Code "@SysInclude { eq }"
in the setup file, or @Code "-ieq" on the command line.  Then, at any point
in the document, write @Code "@Eq  {  ...  }"
and the symbols of Eq will be available between the braces.  Any symbols
available outside continue to be available inside, which means that Eq
can be freely mixed with standard Lout and with symbols from other
packages, without restriction.
@PP
In this report we show the Lout input at the left, and its
result at the right:
@ID {
@Code "@Eq { {x sup 2 + y sup 2} over 2 }"
|7ct
@Eq { {x sup 2 + y sup 2} over 2 }
}
Subsequent examples will omit the enclosing {@Code "@Eq { ... }"}.
