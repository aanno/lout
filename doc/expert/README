Directory lout/doc/expert

This directory contains the Lout source files
for the Expert's Guide to the Lout Document
Formatting System.  To produce the Guide, type
the command

	lout all > outfile.ps

in this directory.  This must be done five times to
completely resolve all cross references, although
the PostScript file outfile.ps is printable after
the first run.  Auxiliary files with .li and .ld
suffixes will be created in this directory.  A
copy of the final outfile.ps is included.  There
should be no warning messages on the fifth run.
