Directory lout/doc/expert

This directory contains the Lout source files for the
Expert's Guide to the Lout Document Formatting System,
formerly known as `Document Formatting with Lout'.
To produce the Guide, type the command

	lout all > outfile.ps

in this directory.  This must be done four times to
completely resolve all cross references, although
the PostScript file outfile.ps is printable after
the first run.  Auxiliary files with .li and .ld
suffixes will be created in this directory.  A copy
of the final outfile.ps is included.

ps The first few runs will generate a large number
of benign error messages, mostly beginning with
"unresolved cross reference".  The error message
output of the fourth run should look like this:

lout file "ch3.00" (from "all" line 36):
     1,1: this component of @BeginFigures did not fit into its nearest target

This just says that a figure within Chapter 3 could
not be placed on the first available page, which is
not a problem here since it can go on a later page.
