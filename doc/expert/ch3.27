These symbols instruct Lout to incorporate a separately created
illustration:
@ID @Code "@IncludeGraphic  \"myportrait.eps\""
The parameter is implementation-dependent; in Basser Lout it is an
object whose value is a simple word denoting the name of a file.  This
file should ideally be a PostScript EPS Version 3.0 file
@Cite { $adobe1990ps }, since then Lout will keep careful track of what
resources are required for printing that file.  However, any PostScript
file containing the @Code "%%BoundingBox:" comment and not requiring
unusual resources is likely to work.
@PP
The result of @@IncludeGraphic is an ordinary Lout object with marks
through its centre.  It may be rotated, scaled, and generally
treated like any other object.  Basser Lout determines its size by
consulting the bounding box information in the file.  If this cannot be
found, a warning message is printed and the result object has zero size.
@PP
@@IncludeGraphic searches the same directories that @@Include does
(Section {@NumberOf include}).  @@SysIncludeGraphic is the same as
@@IncludeGraphic, except that it searches only the directories searched
by @@SysInclude.
