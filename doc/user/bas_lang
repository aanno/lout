When part of a document is written in a language other than English,
languages. @Index { languages other than English }
Lout should be informed of this using the @Code "@Language" symbol:
language. @Index @Code "@Language"
@ID @OneRow @Code {
"... the garter, he said:  French @Language { `Honi soit qui mal y"
"pense' }, and this saying ..."
}
Changing language is quite analogous to changing font using the
@Code "@Font" symbol.
@PP
Since accented characters (Section {@NumberOf characters}) are always
available irrespective of the language, at first sight it might seem
that there is no need to bother informing Lout what language you are
writing in.  However, words are hyphenated differently depending on the
hyphenation.languages @SubIndex { in languages other than English }
language, and some symbols have different results in different
languages.  For example,
@ID @Code "Danish @Language @Date"
produces
@ID { Danish @Language @Date }
date.languages @SubIndex { in languages other than English }
time.languages @SubIndex { in languages other than English }
lists.languages @SubIndex { in languages other than English }
and the alphabetic list symbols of Section {@NumberOf lists} also
vary with the current language.  So it's worth doing for the sake of
knowing that non-English parts will appear as they should.
@PP
At the time of writing, the following languages were available:
@ID @OneRow @Code {
Czech Cesky Cestina
Danish Dansk
Dutch Nederlands
English
Finnish Suomi
French Francais Fran{@Char ccedilla}ais
German Deutsch
Norwegian Norsk
Russian
Slovenian Slovenia Slovenija
Spanish Espa{@Char ntilde}ol
Swedish Svenska
}
As shown, most languages have alternative names, all equally acceptable
to the @Code "@Language" symbol.  Russian also has an alternative name,
but since it is written using Cyrillic characters, we can't show it
here.  For other languages, the only course is to turn hyphenation off
and avoid language-specific symbols such as @Code "@Date" and the
alphabetic lists.
@PP
If your entire document is in a language other than English, you need
to change the @Code "@InitialLanguage" option:
initiallanguage. @Index @Code "@InitialLanguage"
@ID @Code "@InitialLanguage { Deutsch }"
If you are using your own setup file (Section {@NumberOf setup}), you
can change it there.  If not, you can change it at the start of your
document, as explained in Section {@NumberOf ordinary}.
@PP
The fonts listed in Section {@NumberOf fonts} cannot be used with
Czech, Russian and Slovenian, because they do not contain all of the
characters used in those languages.  Consult files @Code "russian.fd" and
@Code "latin2.fd" in the Lout system include directory for the family
and face names of fonts available for use with these languages.  These
fonts, and other material needed for these languages, are distributed
separately from the main Lout distribution.
