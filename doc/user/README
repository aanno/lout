Directory lout/doc/user

This directory contains the Lout source files for the User's Guide
to the Lout Document Formatting System.  To produce the Guide,
type the command

	lout all > op

in this directory.  Owing to some unfortunate page breaks in the
early runs, this must be done six times to completely resolve
all cross references, although the PostScript file op is printable
after the first run.  Auxiliary files with .li and .ld suffixes
will be created in this directory.

The first run will produce a large number of error messages,
nearly all beginning with "unresolved cross reference".  These
should gradually go away on later runs.  The following shows the
error message output on the later runs for A4 size printing:

lout file "gra_summ" (from "gra" line 44, from "all" line 46):
    10,1: 23.7c object too high for 23.6c space; @Scale inserted
lout file "prg_tabs" (from "prg" line 127, from "all" line 48):
   66,23: prg2lout 2,1: program text ended within comment
   68,35: prg2lout 2,1: program text ended within comment

The first warning is about a large table that had to be scaled
down very slightly to fit on the page.  The last two warnings
point to two places where a C program text ended inside a comment,
which in these cases was deliberate.  If you set the document in
Letter size paper, you will get a somewhat different set of warning
messages.

Optimal page breaking has been turned off for this document owing to
repeated failure to converge, caused by footnotes and floating figures
close to large unbreakable displays.

A copy of the final PostScript output file (A4 paper size) is
stored at "ftp://ftp.cs.su.oz.au/jeff/lout/lout-3.28.user.ps.gz".
