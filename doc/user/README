Directory lout/doc/user

This directory contains the Lout source files for the
User's Guide to the Lout Document Formatting System.
To produce the Guide, type the command

	lout user > op

in this directory.  This must be done four times to
completely resolve all cross references, although
the PostScript file op is printable after the first
run.  Auxiliary files with .li and .ld suffixes will
be created in this directory.  A copy of the final
PostScript output file is included (outfile.ps).

ps The first run will produce a large number of error
messages, nearly all beginning with "unresolved cross
reference".  These should gradually go away on later
runs.  The following shows the error message output
on the fourth run for Letter size printing:

lout file "basics.characters" (from "basics" line 16, from "user" line 26):
    12,1: this component of @FootNote did not fit into its nearest target
lout file "structure.footnotes" (from "structure" line 8, from "user" line 27):
    11,1: this component of @FootNote did not fit into its nearest target
lout file "equations.spacing" (from "equations" line 21, from "user" line 32):
    18,1: this component of @FootNote did not fit into its nearest target
lout file "graphs.grsummary" (from "graphs" line 43, from "user" line 35):
     8,1: 22.4c object too high for 21.8c space; @VScale inserted
lout file "cprint.tabs" (from "cprint" line 23, from "user" line 36):
   53,23: c2lout: C text ended inside a comment
   55,35: c2lout: C text ended inside a comment

All these errors are benign; the first three just say
that footnotes were split across two pages, the fourth
means that a large display had to be vertically shrunk
a bit to fit on the page (it fits on an A4 page but
not on a Letter page), and the last two come from the
c2lout filter and say (correctly) that the C text
passed to c2lout ended inside a comment.  The error
messages for A4 printing are a subset of these ones.
