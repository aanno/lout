Directory lout/doc/user

This directory contains the Lout source files for the User's Guide
to the Lout Document Formatting System.  To produce the Guide,
type the command

	lout all > op

in this directory.  This must be done five times to completely
resolve all cross references, although the PostScript file op is
printable after the first run.  Auxiliary files with .li and .ld
suffixes will be created in this directory.

A copy of the final PostScript output file (A4 paper size) is
distributed separately in

    ftp://ftp.cs.su.oz.au/jeff/lout.<version>.user.ps

where <version> is the current version number.

ps The first run will produce a large number of error messages,
nearly all beginning with "unresolved cross reference".  These
should gradually go away on later runs.  The following shows the
error message output on the fifth run for Letter size printing:

lout file "bas_char" (from "bas" line 16, from "all" line 26):
    12,1: this component of @FootNote did not fit into its nearest target
lout file "gra_summ" (from "gra" line 44, from "all" line 35):
     8,1: 22.4c object too high for 21.8c space; @VScale inserted
lout file "cpp_tabs" (from "cpp" line 24, from "all" line 36):
   53,23: c2lout: C text ended inside a comment
   55,35: c2lout: C text ended inside a comment
lout file "ap_qck" (from "all" line 38):
  153,25: 22.9c object too high for 21.8c space; @VScale inserted

The errors when the paper size is A4 are similar to these.  All these
errors are benign; they point to a footnote that appeared on the page
following the page containing the point it referred to, owing to
lack of space on the preceding page; objects that proved to be too
tall to fit on a Letter page, so had to be squashed a bit; and two
points where the c2lout program was asked to format a C program that
ended inside a comment.
