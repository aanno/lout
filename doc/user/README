Directory lout/doc/user

This directory contains the Lout source files for the User's Guide
to the Lout Document Formatting System.  To produce the Guide,
type the command

	lout all > op

in this directory.  This must be done five times to completely
resolve all cross references, although the PostScript file op is
printable after the first run.  Auxiliary files with .li and .ld
suffixes will be created in this directory.

The first run will produce a large number of error messages,
nearly all beginning with "unresolved cross reference".  These
should gradually go away on later runs.  The following shows the
error message output on the fifth run for A4 size printing:

lout file "cpp_tabs" (from "cpp" line 80, from "all" line 45):
   56,23: prg2lout 2,1: program text ended within comment
   58,35: prg2lout 2,1: program text ended within comment

These two warnings point to two places where a C program text ended
inside a comment, which in these cases was deliberate so is no problem.
If you set the document in Letter size paper, you will also get a
couple of other warning messages pointing to places where Lout had
to slightly scale a display to fit the smaller page.

Optimal page breaking has been turned off for this document owing to
repeated failure to converge, caused by footnotes and floating figures
close to large unbreakable displays.

A copy of the final PostScript output file (A4 paper size) is
stored at "ftp://ftp.cs.su.oz.au/jeff/lout/lout-3.18.user.ps.gz".
