Particular types of documents have specialized formatting
requirements:  title pages in books, abstracts in technical reports, and
so on.  Producing such things using the general-purpose features of
previous chapters can be quite awkward, so Lout provides a range of
@I { document types } with the appropriate specialized features for
document.types @Index { document types }
each type.
@PP
At present there are six types:  ordinary documents, technical reports,
books, overhead transparencies, stand-alone illustrations, and plain
text documents.  The features of all other chapters are available within
every document type, but the features of one document type are not
available within other document types.
