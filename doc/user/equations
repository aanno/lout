This chapter explains how to produce mathematical formulas in Lout,
equations. @Index { equations }
mathematics. @Index mathematics
eq. @Index @Code "@Eq"
using the @Code "@Eq" symbol like this:
@ID @Code {
"@Eq { big int supp 1 on 0 ` dx over sqrt {1 - x sup 2} = pi over 2 }"
}
This example produces
@ID @Eq { big int supp 1 on 0 ` dx over sqrt {1 - x sup 2} = pi over 2 }
The @Code "@Eq" symbol looks after all the details of spacing for
you, and it provides several hundred mathematical symbols.
