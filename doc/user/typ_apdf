Starting with Version 3.12, Lout has been enhanced with the option of
providing PDF (Adobe Portable Document Format) output as an alternative
pdf. @Index { PDF documents }
to PostScript.  Any document that can be produced by Lout in
PostScript can be produced in PDF as well, by adding a @Code "-Z"
flag to the Unix command line:
@ID @Code "lout -Z simple > simple.pdf"
No other changes are required.

The PDF output is superior to PostScript in providing links:  when viewed
with a PDF viewer, entries in tables of contents and indexes can be
clicked on and this transports the viewer to the part of the document
referenced by the link.  (Recent versions of PostScript support this
feature too, but Lout's PostScript doesn't.)  However, the PDF output
produced by Lout is inferior at graphics:  the advanced features of the
@Code "@Diag" and @Code "@Graph" packages do not produce any output.  One
can still format documents that contain them, but the results are disappointing.
