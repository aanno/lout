Directory lout/doc/tr.fig

This directory contains the Lout source files for the
technical report describing the Fig figure drawing
package (Version 2).  To produce the report, type
the command

	lout setup s? > outfile.ps

in this directory.  This must be done three times to
completely resolve all cross references, although
the PostScript file outfile.ps is printable after
the first run.  Auxiliary files with .li and .ld
suffixes will be created in this directory.  A copy
of the final outfile.ps is included.
