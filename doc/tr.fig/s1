Fig is a package of Lout definitions for drawing and filling in
arbitrary shapes made from straight lines, circular and elliptical arcs,
and Bezier curves.  Its features are smoothly integrated with the rest
of Lout: one can rotate and concatenate objects created by Fig, draw a
box to fit neatly around any object, etc.  The design of Fig is based
entirely on Brian W. Kernighan's PIC language [{@Ref kernighan82}].  The
implementation of Fig makes good use of the PostScript
@FootNote { PostScript is a trademark of Adobe Systems, Inc. }
page description language [{@Ref adobe90}], which was designed by John
Warnock and others.  Lout was designed and implemented by Jeffrey
H. Kingston [{@Ref kingston92}].
@PP
To use Fig within a Lout document, first ensure that its definition is
included, either by putting @Code "@SysInclude { fig }" at the start of
the document, or @Code "-ifig" on the command line.  Then, anywhere at
all within the document, write
@ID @Code "@Fig {  ...  }"
and the symbols of Fig will be available
between the braces, which may enclose an arbitrary Lout object.  Throughout
this report we will show the Lout text on the left and the corresponding
result on the right, like this:
@ID {
@Code {
"@Fig {"
"   @Square"
"   //0.5c"
"   @Circle"
"}"
}
||7ct
@Fig {
   @Square
   //0.5c
   @Circle
}
}
Subsequent examples will omit the enclosing {@Code "@Fig"}.
