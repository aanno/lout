@Abstract {
This paper describes a new approach to document formatting, in which
features are written in a small, coherent, high-level language called
Lout.  The resulting increase in productivity has permitted many advanced
features to be developed quickly and accurately, including page layout of
unprecedented flexibility, equation formatting, automatically generated
tables of contents, running page headers and footers, cross references,
sorted indexes, and access to bibliographic databases.  A fully operational
production implementation of the Lout system including all these features
and many others is freely available.
