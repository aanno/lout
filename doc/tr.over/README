Directory lout/doc/tr.over

This directory contains the Lout source files for the
report entitled `A new approach to document formatting',
which has so far been submitted to two journals without
success.  I still think it's worth reading! To produce
the report, type the command

	lout setup s? > outfile.ps

in this directory.  This must be done three times to
completely resolve all cross references, although
the PostScript file outfile.ps is printable after
the first run.  Auxiliary files with .li and .ld
suffixes will be created in this directory.  A copy
of the final outfile.ps is included.
