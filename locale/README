Locale-specific error messages

Lout offers the option of locale-specific error messages.  To
get them, install with USELOC set to 1 in the make file, as
described in detail there.  At present the languages supported are:

  msgs.fr	French
  msgs.de	German

If the language you need is not on this list, it probably means that
no-one has got around to translating Lout's 500 or so error messages
into your language yet.  If you are willing to do this translation,
the procedure is as follows:

(1) Send mail to me (jeff@cs.su.oz.au) volunteering your services.

(2) I will send you a file of almost 500 error messages, in English.

(3) You translate this file into your language and return it to me
    in a form that won't be corrupted by email (e.g. uuencoded).

(4) I produce a revised Lout distribution with your translated
    error messages as an integral part, so that they will be
    installed automatically.  You receive this either by ftp or
    by electronic mail, as you prefer.
