Ack and thanks.  I've taken the liberty of forwarding your
mail to the Lout mailing list, basically so that it will
archived.  The warning messages you would get on any
architecture.  They just arise from macro expansions
where the parameters are sometimes constants (these
ones spring the warnings) and sometimes not.

The User Guide contains textures, and these don't
seem to be widely supported in PostScript software.
They are the most likely reason why the conversion
would not work.  You could try compiling again with
the -t option:

       -t     Ignore  texture-changing  options;  everything that
              would otherwise have been printed using  a  texture
              will be printed in solid colour.

although even that has been reported to not fix
the problem in all cases.
